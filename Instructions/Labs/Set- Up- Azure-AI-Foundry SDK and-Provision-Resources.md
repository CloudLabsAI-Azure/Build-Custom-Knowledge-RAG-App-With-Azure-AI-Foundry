# Lab : Build a custom knowledge retrieval (RAG) app with the Azure AI Foundry SDK

## Lab scenario

In this Hands-On Lab, you will learn how to build a custom knowledge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application using the Azure AI Foundry SDK. This lab will guide you through provisioning necessary resources, implementing a retrieval pipeline, and evaluating the systemâ€™s performance. By the end of the session, you will have a functional RAG solution that integrates Azure AI capabilities for enhanced knowledge retrieval and response generation. 

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1: Set Up Azure AI Foundry SDK and Provision Resources 
- Exercise 2: Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline 
- Exercise 3: Evaluate and Optimize RAG Performance 

## Estimated time: 4 hour

## Exercise 1: Set Up Azure AI Foundry SDK and Provision Resources 

### Task 1: Create a project
