# Exercise 01: Developing a Custom RAG App Using Azure AI Foundry

## Estimated Time: 4 Hours

## Lab Scenario

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to build a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using the Azure AI Foundry SDK. You will begin by setting up the required Azure resources and configuring the AI Foundry environment. Then, you will implement an RAG pipeline that indexes and retrieves relevant data to enhance AI-generated responses. Finally, you will evaluate and optimize the systemâ€™s performance by measuring retrieval accuracy, response quality, and efficiency. By the end of the session, you will have a functional RAG solution that integrates Azure AI capabilities for enhanced knowledge retrieval and response generation. 

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1: Set Up Azure AI Foundry SDK and Provision Resources
